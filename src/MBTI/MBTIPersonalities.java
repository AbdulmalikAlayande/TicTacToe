				•	The Inspector (ISTJ Personality)
				ISTJs are serious, proper, and formal in appearance which can be intimidating. They are cultured and have an affection towards tradition.
				In contrast, they are quiet and usually calm.  They are called inspectors because of their keen attention to detail. ISTJ are rule followers,
				who always take the logical approach towards their goals and projects. Their dominant cognitive function is introverted sensing which helps
				them take in the details about their environment while their auxiliary cognitive function is extraverted thinking which makes them efficient and logical thinkers.
				In their relationships, they are very loyal to their friends and family members. Usually, they have a small circle with who they prefer spending their time with.
				The ISTJ thrives in jobs that require structure, logic, and stability.
				
				The ISTJ Personality Type
				ISTJs are responsible organizers, driven to create and enforce order within systems and institutions. They are neat and orderly, inside and out,
				and tend to have a procedure for everything they do. Reliable and dutiful, ISTJs want to uphold tradition and follow regulations.
				ISTJs are steady, productive contributors. Although they are Introverted, ISTJs are rarely isolated; typical ISTJs know just where they belong in life,
				and want to understand how they can participate in established organizations and systems. They concern themselves with maintaining the social order and making sure that standards are met.
				What does ISTJ stand for?
				ISTJ is an acronym used to describe one of the sixteen personality types created by Katharine Briggs and Isabel Myers. It stands for Introverted, Sensing, Thinking, Judging. ISTJ indicates a person who is energized by time spent alone (Introverted), who focuses on facts and details rather than ideas and concepts (Sensing), who makes decisions based on logic and reason (Thinking) and who prefers to be planned and organized rather than spontaneous and flexible (Judging). ISTJs are sometimes referred to as Inspector personalities because of their focus on details and interest in doing things correctly.
				ISTJ Values and Motivations
				ISTJs like to know what the rules of the game are, valuing predictability more than imagination. They rely on their past experience to guide them, and are most comfortable in familiar surroundings. ISTJs trust the proven method, and appreciate the value of dedicated practice to build confidence in their skills.
				ISTJs are hardworking and will persist until a task is done. They are logical and methodical, and often enjoy tasks that require them to use step-by-step reasoning to solve a problem. They are meticulous in their attention to details, and examine things closely to be sure they are correct. With their straightforward logic and orientation to detail, ISTJs work systematically to bring order to their own small parts of the world.
				How Others See the ISTJ
				ISTJs have a serious, conservative air about them. They want to know and follow the rules of the game, and typically seek out predictable surroundings where they understand their role. You may find the ISTJ doing something useful even in social situations (for instance, organizing coats and hats at a party) as they’re often more comfortable taking charge of a task than they are chatting up strangers. When given something to do, they are highly dependable, and follow it through to the end.
				ISTJs are practical and no-nonsense, and rarely call attention to themselves. Their clothes and possessions tend to be chosen based on utility rather than fashion, and they have an affection for the classics. ISTJs typically speak in a straightforward manner and have a good head for details. They are usually more enthusiastic about sharing factual information than exploring abstract concepts or unproven ideas.
				How rare is the ISTJ personality type?
				ISTJ is the third most common type in the population and the most common type among men. ISTJs make up:
				•	12% of the general population
				•	16% of men
				•	7% of women
								
				Famous ISTJs
				Famous ISTJs include Queen Elizabeth II, Harry Truman, Warren Buffett, Queen Victoria, George H.W. Bush, and J.D. Rockefeller.
				
				ISTJ Quotes
				"Whether at home or at work, ISTJs are nothing if not reliable, particularly when it comes to inspecting the people and things in their jurisdiction—quietly seeing to it that uniform quality of product is maintained, and that those around them uphold certain standards of attitude and conduct."
				- David Keirsey, Please Understand Me II\s
				"ISTJ is a no-frills, work-hard, play-hard type. They are seen as compulsive, hard-charging, capable, and true to their word."
				- Otto Kroeger, Type Talk at Work
				"All contracts should be cleared by ISTJs; they will overlook nothing that is in it and assume nothing that is not."
				- Isabel Briggs Myers, Gifts Differing
				ISTJ Strengths
				Perseverance. The ISTJ’s main and most admirable strength is perseverance; people of this type simply do not give up. This trait is advantageous to them and can be that which sets them apart in their careers. Their peers and competitors may possess greater skills, but few will match the ISTJ in dogged commitment.\s
				Planning. Because of the ISTJ’s Judging component, people of this type have a very clear command of time and priorities. They are quite skilled in planning, organizing, mapping out schedules and following agendas. They excel in time management, are punctual (and demand the same of others) and consistently meet their deadlines.
				Detail orientation. ISTJs notice holes, gaps, errors that broader thinkers don’t. They like facts, details and numbers without the emotional or interpretive fluff. And they don’t take facts or information for granted, nor do they rely on it simply because someone else said so. They will check things out for themselves, meticulously.
				Loyalty. ISTJs also have a natural instinct to protect and defend. Loyal, reliable and committed, these are people that can be depended on to guard everything from their families to our nation and these are responsibilities they proudly assume. To the institutions, organizations and people to which they are committed, they are unwavering in their service.\s

				•	The Counselor (INFJ Personality)
				INFJs are visionaries who have a different view of the world. They love introspection and refuse to take things at a surface level. They could be termed weird by others because of how they see life. The INFJ are idealists who love understanding complex issues. They are reserved leaders who are usually creatives due to how easily they get inspired.
				Also known as the diplomats, the INFJ prefers to cooperate with members of their team as opposed to conflict.
				The dominant cognitive function of an INFJ is introverted intuition which helps them focus on internal insights and generally influences their decision-making. Their tertiary cognitive function is an extraverted feeling which makes them highly sensitive to the feeling of others or what others refer to as being empathetic.\s
				The INFJ thrives in jobs that require a deal of compassion, psychology, and/or collaboration.
				The INFJ Personality Type
				INFJs are thoughtful nurturers with a strong sense of personal integrity and a drive to help others realize their potential. Creative and dedicated, they have a talent for helping others with original solutions to their personal challenges.
				The Counselor has a unique ability to intuit others' emotions and motivations, and will often know how someone else is feeling before that person knows it himself. They trust their insights about others and have strong faith in their ability to read people. Although they are sensitive, they are also reserved; the INFJ is a private sort, and is selective about sharing intimate thoughts and feelings.
				INFJs search for meaning and purpose in their lives and in the outer world. They tend to have an immense interest in deeply understanding culture, society, and the universe as a whole. INFJs naturally see how every thought or action could potentially have important consequences, either positive or negative. This reflective and curious worldview gives INFJs a unique perspective and thoughtful approach to how they interact with others and the world around them.
				Ultimately, INFJs seek to turn their abstract and intellectual musings into concrete actions that can be applied and make a transformative impact on others. Although it is common for INFJs to get stuck in their heads and struggle with taking action, when they are at their best, their actions are aligned with their authentic values.
				What does INFJ stand for?
				INFJ is one of the sixteen personality types created by Katharine Briggs and Isabel Myers, creators of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI®).\s
				Each of the four letters of the INFJ code signifies a key personality trait of this type. The letters INFJ stand for the following dimensions of personality, based on the work of psychologist C.G. Jung:
				
				•	Introverted: INFJs are energized by time alone\s
				•	iNtuitive: INFJs focus on ideas and concepts rather than facts and details\s
				•	Feeling: INFJs make decisions based on feelings and values\s
				•	Judging: INFJs prefer to be planned and organized rather than spontaneous and flexible\s
				The INFJ personality type is also called the "Counselor" because of their tendency to be idealistic, compassionate, and sensitive. Other nicknames for the INFJ include:
				•	The Insightful Visionary (MBTI)
				•	The Advocate (16Personalities)
				INFJ Values and Motivations
				INFJs are guided by a deeply considered set of personal values. They are intensely idealistic, and can clearly imagine a happier and more perfect future. They can become discouraged by the harsh realities of the present, but they are typically motivated and persistent in taking positive action nonetheless. The INFJ feels an intrinsic drive to do what they can to make the world a better place.
				INFJs want a meaningful life and deep connections with other people. They do not tend to share themselves freely but appreciate emotional intimacy with a select, committed few. Although their rich inner life can sometimes make them seem mysterious or private to others, they profoundly value authentic connections with people they trust.
				As quintessential idealists, INFJs have many ideas about how to improve society and make the world a better place. INFJs believe a better world can only be attained if we concentrate on doing what is right, regardless of short-term consequences. However, harmonious relationships are also extremely important to the INFJ. They are skilled mediators who look for the root sources of conflict to find common ground with others. Because of this, they tend to prefer a diplomatic communication style and are careful to not unnecessarily ruffle feathers.
				INFJs have a profound respect for human potential and a deep interest in understanding the mind. Because of this, they are motivated to pursue authentic self-development and strive to live up to their true potential, while encouraging and guiding others to do the same. According to idealistic INFJs, if we believe in our ability to accomplish the extraordinary, the extraordinary will instantly become a possibility — “dream it and you can achieve it,” as the saying goes. However, because of their integrity and empathy for others, it is uncommon for INFJs to cut corners or hurt others to achieve their desired future state.
				How Others See the INFJ
				INFJs often appear quiet, caring and sensitive, and may be found listening attentively to someone else’s ideas or concerns. They are highly perceptive about people and want to help others achieve understanding. INFJs are not afraid of complex personal problems; in fact, they are quite complex themselves, and have a rich inner life that few are privy to. They reflect at length on issues of ethics, and feel things deeply. Because Counselors initially appear so gentle and reserved, they may surprise others with their intensity when one of their values is threatened or called into question. Their calm exterior belies the complexity of their inner worlds.
				Because INFJs are such complex people, they may be reluctant to engage with others who might not understand or appreciate them, and can thus be hard to get to know. Although they want to get along with others and support them in their goals, they are fiercely loyal to their own system of values and will not follow others down a path that does not feel authentic to them. When they sense that their values are not being respected, or when their intuition tells them that someone’s intentions are not pure, they are likely to withdraw.
				Acquaintances of INFJs would likely describe them as quiet, intelligent, serious, gentle, and possibly a bit reclusive. Others generally perceive INFJs as pleasant people to be around, but may also notice that they can be moody, aloof, or even somewhat crabby on occasion. All in all, people who only encounter them infrequently are likely to see INFJs as tough nuts to crack and may even find them to be a bit intimidating.
				Those closer to an INFJ will likely see beneath the surface and recognize the INFJs depth of empathy and their curious and insightful nature. When family members, friends or trusted co-workers need constructive feedback and a fresh perspective, INFJs are always standing by, ready to offer sensible and helpful input.
				INFJs like to put out fires, not start them. When they occupy positions on work teams, non-profit boards, PTAs, city councils, organizing committees or task forces, others learn to appreciate their uncanny ability to defuse tensions, soothe wounded feelings, smooth ruffled feathers, arbitrate petty squabbles and restore the spirit of cooperation whenever it has been compromised.
				How rare is the INFJ personality type?
				INFJ is the rarest type in the population. It is the least common type among men, and the third least common among women (after INTJ and ENTJ). INFJs make up:
				•	2% of the general population
				•	2% of women

				- Isabel Briggs Myers, Gifts Differing\s
				"These seclusive and friendly people are complicated themselves, and so can understand and deal with complex ethical issues and with deeply troubled individuals."
				- David Keirsey, Please Understand Me II

				The INTJ Personality Type
				INTJs are analytical problem-solvers, eager to improve systems and processes with their innovative ideas. They have a talent for seeing possibilities for improvement, whether at work, at home, or in themselves.
				Often intellectual, INTJs enjoy logical reasoning and complex problem-solving. They approach life by analyzing the theory behind what they see, and are typically focused inward, on their own thoughtful study of the world around them. INTJs are drawn to logical systems and are much less comfortable with the unpredictable nature of other people and their emotions. They are typically independent and selective about their relationships, preferring to associate with people who they find intellectually stimulating.
				What does INTJ stand for?
				INTJ is one of the sixteen personality types created by Katharine Briggs and Isabel Myers, creators of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI®). INTJ stands for Introverted, iNtuitive, Thinking, Judging, which are four core personality traits based on the work of psychologist C.G. Jung.
				Each of the four letters of the INTJ code signifies a key personality trait of this type. INTJs are energized by time alone (Introverted), focus on ideas and concepts rather than facts and details (iNtuitive), make decisions based on logic and reason (Thinking) and prefer to be planned and organized rather than spontaneous and flexible (Judging).
				INTJs are sometimes referred to as Mastermind personalities because of their strategic, logical way of thinking. Other nicknames for the INTJ include:
				•	The Conceptual Planner (MBTI)
				•	The Architect (16Personalities)
				INTJ Values and Motivations
				INTJs are perceptive about systems and strategy, and often understand the world as a chess board to be navigated. They want to understand how systems work, and how events proceed: the INTJ often has a unique ability to foresee logical outcomes. They enjoy applying themselves to a project or idea in depth, and putting in concentrated effort to achieve their goals.
				INTJs have a hunger for knowledge and strive to constantly increase their competence; they are often perfectionists with extremely high standards of performance for themselves and others. They tend to have a keen interest in self-improvement and are lifelong learners, always looking to add to their base of information and awareness.
				How Others See the INTJ
				INTJs are typically reserved and serious, and seem to spend a lot of time thinking. They are curious about the world around them and often want to know the principle behind what they see. They thoroughly examine the information they receive, and if asked a question, will typically consider it at length before presenting a careful, complex answer. INTJs think critically and clearly, and often have an idea about how to do something more efficiently. They can be blunt in their presentation, and often communicate in terms of the larger strategy, leaving out the details.
				Although INTJs aren’t usually warm or particularly gregarious, they tend to have a self-assured manner with people based on their own security in their intelligence. They relate their ideas with confidence, and once they have arrived at a conclusion they fully expect others to see the wisdom in their perceptions. They are typically perfectionists and appreciate an environment of intellectual challenge. They enjoy discussing interesting ideas, and may get themselves into trouble because of their take-no-prisoners attitude: if someone’s beliefs don’t make logical sense, the Mastermind typically has no qualms about pointing that out.

				"Their capacity for intellectual and conceptual clarity gives INTJs both vision and the will to see it through to completion—leadership qualities that are prized in our society."

				INFP is one of the sixteen personality types created by Katharine Briggs and Isabel Myers, creators of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI®). INFP stands for Introversion, iNtuition, Feeling, and Perceiving, which are four core personality traits based on the work of psychologist C.G. Jung.
				Each of the four letters of the INFP code signifies a key personality trait of this type. INFPs are energized by time alone (Introverted), focus on ideas and concepts rather than facts and details (intuitive (N)), make decisions based on feelings and values (Feeling), and prefer to be spontaneous and flexible rather than planned and organized (Perceiving).
				The INFP personality type is also called the "Healer" because of their sympathetic idealism and gentle compassion for other people. Other nicknames for the INFP include:
				•	The Thoughtful Idealist (MBTI)
				•	The Mediator (16Personalities)
				INFP Values and Motivations
				INFPs value authenticity and want to be original and individual in what they do. They are often concerned with a search for meaning and truth within themselves. Following tradition holds little appeal for the INFP; they prefer to do their own exploration of values and ideas, and decide for themselves what seems right. INFPs are often offbeat and unconventional, but they feel no desire to conform. The INFP would rather be true to themselves than try to fit in with the crowd.
				INFPs are accepting and nonjudgmental in their treatment of others, believing that each person must follow their own path. They are flexible and accommodating, and can often see many points of view. It is important to the INFP to support other people; however, the INFP may react strongly if they feel their own values are being violated. They especially hate being steamrolled by people who insist there is one right way to do things. INFPs want an open, supportive exchange of ideas.
				How Others See the INFP
				INFPs may initially seem cool, as they reserve their most authentic thoughts and feelings for people they know well. They are reflective and often spiritual, and often interested in having meaningful conversations about values, ethics, people, and personal growth. Typically curious and open-minded, the Healer continually seeks a deeper understanding of themselves and of the people around them. They are passionate about their ideals, but private as well; few people understand the depth of the INFP’s commitment to their beliefs.
				INFPs are sensitive and empathetic, and engage themselves in a lifelong quest for meaning and authenticity. The mundane aspects of life are of less interest to this type, and they are more excited by interesting ideas than by practical facts. They typically accept others without question, and may take special interest in offbeat points of view or alternative lifestyles. They often have a special affection for the arts, especially the Avant garde, as they love experiencing new concepts in self-expression.
				How rare is the INFP personality type?
				INFP is the ninth most common type in the population. They make up:
				•	4% of the general population
				•	5% of women
				•	4% of men
				Famous INFPs
